# -Agentic-Energy-AI
Built an agentic AI pipeline to process Duke Energy bills using a multi-cloud setup: Oracle object storage for raw data ingestion, Oracle-hosted Milvus for vector storage, Ollama LLM for RAG-based insights, and Databricks for analytics dashboards. The system updates automatically with each new bill.
